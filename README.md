<hr>
<p>The app is not running in hugging face due to a 410 error, which I couldn't fix.</p>
<p>The app has run succesfully in my local machine using "streamlit run app.py". Note that, the model folder couldn't be uploaded to GitHub as the file size were over GitHub's allowed size. The model folder has been uploaded to HuggingFace Models page(link provided above). This directory should be in the same directory as app.py and named 'model-patent-score'. After this we can run streamlit application app.py using the command given in quotes above.</p>
<p>I am providing screenshots of the running app below</p>
